# Measuring RPKI ROV adoption over time

Using the methodology described in the paper: [*To Filter or not to Filter: Measuring the Benefits of Registering in the RPKI Today* ](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ctestart8/RPKIfiltering.html), here are the most recent graphs generated using the data available in [*this repository.* ](https://github.com/ctestart/BGP-RPKI-ROV)

## Fraction of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that are deploying ROV from all the ASes share their full routing table with BGP collectors

## IPv4 BGP routes invalid with respect to RPKI of large ASes over time (measured on the 1st of each month)
